/* this is a C++ class for calculating event rates for signals of the Minimal

 */

/* this version of the code was written mainly by Ben O'Leary ("BOL",
 * benjamin.oleary@gmail.com), based on a setup decided upon by Michael Kr√§mer
 * ("MK", mkraemer@physik.rwth-aachen.de), Jonas Lindert ("JL",
 * jonas.lindert@googlemail.com) and BOL. Quite a lot is a refactoring of
 * JL's code. the cross-section grids were created by JL, while the current
 * acceptance grids were written by Carsten Robens
 * ("CR", Carsten.Robens@rwth-aachen.de).
 */
