  /* this is a template class to hold a vector of pointers to objects. the main
   * use is when the objects are slow to construct but fast to reset.
   * it needs to be used with storedClass objects that have default
   * constructors that can be called with "new storedClass".
   * usage: the intended use is that addNewAtEnd() takes over the role of
   * memory allocation. instead of
   * storedClass* egPointer = new storedClass;
   * the allocation is done with
   * storedClass* egPointer = egMinimalAllocationVector.addNewAtEnd();
   * & then carry on as normal, except egMinimalAllocationVector will free up
   * the memory on its own, so you should *never* try to delete the pointer
   * yourself.
   * when the collection needs to be reset, call clearEntries(), but beware
   * that the next pointers returned by addNewAtEnd() will point to old objects
   * from before the calling of clearEntries()! you need to reset the objects
   * yourself.
   * I had made a version with a stored function pointer to allow the objects
   * to be reset as they are passed out, but in the end I felt that it couldn't
   * be flexible enough to be really useful. the functionality has been moved
   * into
   * addNewAtEnd( void (*makeAsDefaultConstructorWould)( storedClass* const ) )
   * for obtaining consistent new objects. (makeAsDefaultConstructorWould does
   * not _have_ to set the object's properties to be as they would be when
   * constructed by the default constructor, but this is the use intended.)
